In this game, you use the arrow keys to dodge the falling snowballs. You are also able to shoot an egg if you are in danger, destroying a snowball, but there can be 
more than one snowball in the same place. Also, the cooldown for the egg is in the top right corner, and to use it press space.

Furthermore, you need a library called Ursina to run this program.
